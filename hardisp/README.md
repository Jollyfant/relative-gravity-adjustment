# HARDISP Code (WIP)

Taken from the IERS conventions, chapter 7 Software. Downloadable from: https://iers-conventions.obspm.fr. Software may be subject to a license. The code can be compiled by calling `make`, and should created the HARDISP executable. The output of HARDISP appears to be in metres, and I am not sure how to convert this to gravity just yet.
